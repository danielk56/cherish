1,"Stop asking your teen to do their chores. Try this instead. What do you do if getting your teen to do chores feels like an everyday battle? “Charlie, can you pick your socks up off the ground?” “Yeah, I’ll do it later.” “I mean now, before you have soccer practice.” “Yeah, mom, I said later.” Getting your teen to do chores around the house can be a challenge. Although it may be tempting to give your teen a nudge until the task is done, research shows that nagging is rarely a good idea. Here’s how to raise a responsible teen capable of tackling both the dishload and a world of responsibility. Why nagging doesn’t work. When you set up 5 blaring alarms for your 9am wake up call, are you more or less likely to wake up the first time? Nagging can make us dread tasks even before we start to do them. This can lead to a relentless cycle of repetitive reminders, incomplete chores, and frustration for you and your teen. Beyond dread, nagging sets up a power war between parents and teens — and there are no winners. Your teen is navigating a new sense of autonomy and nagging can make your teen feel as if you don’t trust them with this newfound responsibility. With incessant nagging, you risk pushing your teen into a behavior of defiance to take back their sense of control. This means they intentionally refuse whatever task you ask them to do. That’s when small things like asking your teen to put their socks away results in a big fat no. Power-seeking kids want to resist authority no matter the task and this can be exacerbated with nagging. Think like a boss. In the workplace, the worst bosses micromanage. Great bosses entrust their employees to take on certain responsibilities. They mentor their employees to help them grow and manage new roles. Adopting this empowering mindset can be helpful when approaching teens and chores. Instead, try allowing your teen to develop an intuition for the responsibility by empowering them. Julie Lythcott-Haims, former Dean of Freshmen at Stanford University and author of explains: “At work we call it micromanaging versus empowerment. If I monitor every single tiny step of a person’s work in the office, they call that micromanaging; if I give someone a lot of rope and let them take risks and make decisions, they call that empowerment. If I’m empowering my employees, why would I not also empower my kids?” Empowerment stems from allowing your teen to show you what they’re capable of being responsible for. If you give them a task, let them take risks, make decisions, and make mistakes. Then, guide them towards independence as a good boss would do. Beginning at age 12, the prefrontal cortex, or the decision making part of the brain, begins to mature and develop. Allowing them to exercise this part of their brain can be instrumental in their emotional development and delineates a child from a teen. Here’s what it comes down to: nagging ≠ empowering. Often, parents use chores to gauge the preparedness of their teen for “the real world,” but parents need to remember to let their teen mature and flourish on their own timeline without micromanaging at every stage. Raising an empowered teen is raising a responsible teen."
2,"Isolation-induced depression during COVID-19: Is your teen at risk? Consequences of social isolation. No one expected “quarantine” or “social distancing” to enter the world’s shared vocabulary in 2020. As our homes continue to act as the backdrop of everyday life, many parents have reported increased moodiness, listlessness, and irritability in their teens. The pandemic is taking an emotional toll on many young people. This goes beyond “teens being teens”: a recent study conducted in the midst of COVID-19 shows that physical isolation increases the likelihood of a variety of psychological problems, including panic disorder, anxiety, and depression. These results are not unexpected, given that the risks of social isolation are well known. Being physically isolated from friends may contribute to negative feelings of loneliness and raise stress and anxiety levels in your teens. With this generation of teens already being the loneliest cohort in America — yes, even more so than the elderly — the impact of recent events may be particularly acute. Here are some ways to minimize the risks associated with isolation-induced depression in your home. Ways to minimize the risks of isolation-induced depression. 1. Look for warning signs in your teen. Teens who need parental support for their stress management may not know how to communicate their needs. Tantrums and receiving the cold shoulder aren’t foreign to many parents. However, in these trying times, parents may need to pay extra attention to warning signs buried in these tantrums. While heightened stress is to be expected during this pandemic, look for these signs that may indicate stress is overwhelming your teen: Your teen regularly has unusual mood swings (involving anger and hopelessness, for example). Your teen no longer finds joy in activities they previously loved (e.g., texting friends, playing an instrument). Your teen has a highly erratic sleep schedule (e.g., sleeping throughout the day, trouble sleeping well). Your teen has a highly unusual appetite change. If any of these signs surface in your teen, it may be a good moment to practice empathy by gently asking them about their stress levels and exploring together ways you may support them. 2. Don’t dwell too much on COVID-19. While the media marches onwards with facts, rumors, and lies about the coronavirus, you and your teen don’t have to. Getting too caught up in the uncertainty of COVID-19 may lead to unnecessarily high anxiety levels. The simplest path forward may be to just set a hard limit on how long your teen can be on their phone, but actually, the best solution includes your own cooperation. According to The Kazdin Method for Parenting the Defiant Child , “Modeling is a very strong way to teach behavior, stronger than punishment…” As you spend more time with your teen, take advantage of the increased opportunities for you to model healthy media consumption. This could mean setting limits on how much to consume, taking detox breaks from the news, and making sure you don’t consume stress-inducing media before bed. These practices could result in good stress management not only for yourself, but also for your teen — which tends to be a positive cycle! 3. Structure well-being into your days. According to the Center for Disease Control, regularly engaging in self-care practices is a healthy coping mechanism for stressful situations. While this may mean different activities for different people, some common examples include video-chatting with those in your social support systems, be it friends or faith-based organizations. Some may find peace in or regular meditation or regular exercise. Others find comfort in structure simply by eating three balanced meals throughout the day. Encourage these practices in your household and have open conversations about what each family member likes to do for self-care. Here are suggestions for family habits that increase your family’s focus on well-being: Every morning at breakfast, ask your kids what they plan to do during the day to practice self-care. Have everyone download the same meditation app, and do ten-minute group meditations after lunchtime. Create a jar filled with post-it notes of self-care activities that everyone can do after dinnertime. Resources to get help.

3,"Why “Get over it” is bad advice for your teen How you comfort your teen really matters, but most of us grew up with emotionally invalidating statements. Here are strategies to validate your teen’s emotions the next time they come to you with big feelings. Have you ever said “Get over it”, “At least it’s not…” or “You shouldn’t feel bad!” to your teen? Research shows that children who grow up hearing phrases like these often have challenges with regulating their emotions as they grow up. Parents often believe that they are comforting their teen with these phrases by providing perspective or showing their teen “tough love.” However, while you may know the situation is not as grave as your teen makes it out to be, the situation could still feel colossal to your teen who may hear your words as criticism rather than comfort. In response to this perceived criticism, many teens cope by internalizing their feelings as wrong, morphing “unacceptable” emotions (such as anger) into other outlets, or building protective mechanisms against attachment and love. No matter what the intention is, phrases that imply your teen’s emotions are wrong or unimportant is a form of emotional invalidation. Researchers classify chronic emotional invalidation as a form of emotional neglect, which is the failure to notice a child’s emotions or a failure to respond to a child’s emotional needs. Emotional invalidation in childhood and adolescence has been linked to a lower ability to regulate emotions and a variety of maladaptive outcomes, such as self-harm, eating disorders, and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Of course, no parent intends to emotionally neglect their child. Parents often comfort by minimizing situations or emotions because they don’t want to see their teen struggle with conflict or appear “weak.” They may even believe that if their teen can’t handle this, then their teen won’t be able to handle “worse” things in life. After all, the most common parenting goal is to raise responsible adults who are capable of taking on the world. The counterintuitive truth is that since you can’t shield your teen from every hurdle, you can help your teen develop critical self regulation skills by letting them feel their big emotions and acknowledging their challenges. At this point, you may be wondering whether there’s anything you can do to turn this around. There is! Begin by reflecting on your responses to your teen expressing emotions. Are you comfortable accepting their emotions? Or do you question their emotions and jump to help them find solutions? More often than not, teens are looking for empathy when they vent, so hearing and accepting your teen’s emotions is a double win — you’re practicing emotional validation and connecting with your teen. If you find it difficult to accept your teen’s emotions, get curious about your own feelings towards the subject. Do you find it hard to relate? Perhaps you are still learning to validate your own emotions or are driven out of anxiety about your child’s future? If so, how might these obstacles impact your ability to accept your child’s big feelings? Understanding the root cause behind the urge to minimize a teen’s feelings will help identify the steps needed to turn things around. Although “Get over it” may stem from parents wanting to raise a mature teen capable of handling their emotions, it may be doing the opposite. As a parent, it’s okay not to have the answers, and instead, simply witness your teen’s emotional struggles. Next time your teen comes to you with their feelings, try leaning in to the discomfort with questions like “Wow, that sounds really tough. Where’s this feeling coming from?” When they begin to elaborate on their feelings, try “Could you tell me more about that?” and “Why do you think you felt that way?” Phrases like these can show that you’re interested in listening to the situation from your teen’s perspective and that you’re invested in guiding them to a solution without immediately imposing your advice. This leaves your teen feeling that their emotions are valid, that their voice is heard, and most of all — that they matter.

4,"Mentalization, the secret key to better interpersonal relationships. Exasperated at your teen for yet another argument? Try mentalization. In essence, this is the ability to understand our own and others’ behaviors in terms of internal psychological states. It develops from a deep sense of security that children have towards their parental figures, and it enables them to control their emotions. We recently spoke to Dr. Eunice Yuen, who is a psychiatry fellow at the Yale Child Study Center and founder of CHATogether, an organization that aims to promote mental wellness in Asian American communities. She emphasizes the importance of mentalization as fundamental to healthy interpersonal relationships, especially those between parents and their teens. More specifically, mentalization is the “effort that an individual makes to understand other people, in terms of their thoughts, their feelings, their wishes, their beliefs, [and] their desires.” According to clinical psychologist Peter Fonagy, it is a way to understand others’ behaviors as consequences of their feelings and thoughts, as opposed to seeing behavior as arbitrary action that arises from nothing. Therefore, by mentalizing, one charitably sees the explanations for others’ behaviors, and this extra layer of interpretation fundamentally changes one’s attitude and responses toward others. For example, when your teen oversleeps, misses an important exam at school, and throws a tantrum at you when they come back home, your immediate response may be to shout back at them out of frustration. Alternatively, you could mentalize by reasoning about the source of their tantrum. Perhaps they got extremely stressed, and the only way they could cope with this mountain of negative emotions is to lash out at others, even you. While this reasoning by no means justifies their response, it may encourage you to approach the situation more calmly and with more understanding. Although mentalization’s underlying psychological mechanisms are similar to that of cognitive empathy, the two capacities activate different neural-cognitive circuits in the brain, since the former focuses on attributing cognitions, whereas the latter focuses on attributing emotions. While their specific relationship is not yet fully fleshed out, some scholars consider mentalizing as essential to empathy. Nevertheless, the two capacities are distinct from one another. Increasing our mentalizing capacities creates positive downstream effects. These capacities rely on an astute awareness of the self and others during social interactions. Unsurprisingly, mentalizing may boost key perspective-taking behaviors and decrease feelings of distress. It gives us a greater sense of responsibility for what we do, since we recognize that our actions result in consequences that directly affect others’ beliefs and emotions. Unconscious power dynamics actually get in the way of an individual’s ability to mentalize. So, when your thoughts and feelings diverge from your teen’s, try to let go a little and see if it’s beneficial to let them think their own thoughts and feel their own feelings first. Moreover, by mentalizing themselves, parents help develop the skill of mentalization in their children. What does mentalizing actually look like day-to-day? Dr. Yuen draws an example grounded in the common quarantine experience that many are enduring in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Parents could mentalize by trying to understand — with as much curiosity and as little judgment as possible — what teens may be experiencing during this unprecedented time. Abrupt transitions to online school, cancelled proms, and physical isolation from close friends are just a few of the things they’re going through. So, this may explain the otherwise unusual instances of grumpiness. And on the flipside, teens could mentalize by trying to understand just the delicate balance of responsibilities, full-time remote work and full-time childcare combined, that their parents are juggling. This may explain their parents’ otherwise unusual instances of forgetfulness or fatigue. Mutual understanding may prevent or de-escalate conflict, and it fosters a more positive, forgiving home environment. In Dr. Yuen’s experience, a common source of parent-teen conflict stems from an assumption that many parents hold about their adolescent children: that their teens are adults. They may physically look like adults, they may consume the same media as adults, and they may even engage in sophisticated reasoning that rivals an adult’s. Ultimately, though, teens are just not yet adults. They have an underdeveloped prefrontal cortex, which is the part of the brain that’s responsible for executive decision-making. And the period of adolescence is also marked by ongoing psychological development and maturation. They are figuring out their social identity and values (just to give a few examples!), and this oftentimes creates much confusion and angst for them. Therefore, teens simply aren’t able to make decisions in the same ways that adults do. Remembering this in daily life also promotes parental mentalization capacities. The next time that you and your teen are approaching a standoff, here’s what you can do: Pat: I can’t believe you won’t let me go to the mall with my friends. I haven’t seen them since before online school started! Mom: I know that you miss your friends, and it’s hard on you to not spend time with them in person. But, we are in the middle of a global pandemic, and we can’t continue life normally just yet. Pat: I miss them. Mom: I know you do. Let’s compromise. Can you do a virtual activity with your friends, like an online escape room or online party games? Pat: I guess that sounds alright. Let me call them. Thanks, Mom. Lastly, Dr. Yuen draws an analogy between toddlers and teens. Toddlers want the comfort of their parents’ presence as they play in the sandbox by themselves. Similarly, teens want the security knowing that their parents are by their sides, and they also want the space to develop their autonomy and grow into a full-fledged adult. Mentalization may just help along the way. We spoke with Eunice Yuen, MD, PhD, PGY-6 fellow in the Albert Solnit Integrated Adult and Child Psychiatry Research Training Program, Yale Child Study Center."
5,"The case for increasing screen time during quarantine. It’s normal to worry about your teen’s screen time usage, especially with research over the last decade pointing to screen time as a culprit in skyrocketing depression rates among teens. However, in the age of COVID-19, screen time norms should be reconsidered. Results from Pearson’s parent pulse report indicate that about 76% of parents in the US are removing screen time limits for their teens during COVID-19, as they believe the pros of technology outweigh the cons. In fact, 84% of parents think that technology is making their child more self-sufficient under the current circumstances. In this article, we will discuss the benefits of increasing screen time usage during quarantine and how to help teens develop a healthy relationship with screens. There are two key lessons from research about teens and screen time usage (prior to COVID-19): Teens are expected to have at most 2 hours of recreational screen time per day for healthy development, as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). The majority of teenagers have definitely crossed that recommended limit. In fact, US teens spend more than seven hours per day on average for on-screen leisure activities.
If you were worried your teen spent “too much time online” prior to COVID-19, it has probably been even harder to keep your teen’s screen time down during the past few months. However, if parents take a step back and see the situation through their teenager’s point of view, screens are simply where their life is taking place now. When we asked teenagers about their most pressing challenge in the last 3 months, the majority pointed to adapting to online school as their biggest stressor. Not only that, they also expressed how challenging it has been to be away from their friends and have limited options for outdoor activities. Since the usual offline activities are restricted and their whole life has now shifted online, parents need to judge the situation in a different light and take in information from old articles and findings on screen time with a grain of salt. Experts have suggested that it is actually quite normal and healthy for teens to increase their daily screen time during this social isolation period, since the pandemic and lockdown may cause problems like post traumatic stress, depression, and anxiety. There is a higher need for social interaction and the lack thereof can interfere with both mental and physical health. The majority of teens consider their friends as the main source of support and it is natural for them to reallocate their usual social time to online formats, whether it is gaming or video calling with friends. Recreational screen time can also help distract teens from focusing too much on the excessive amount of negative news that can evoke anxiety and affect their mental health. However, as with everything, moderation is key. After all, the adolescent brain is more prone to developing mental health problems and forming bad habits, so creating structure is still crucial during these uncertain times. Here are a few things parents need to keep in mind when it comes to helping teens develop a healthy relationship with screens: Find the right balance between online and offline activities. Teens need to know how to prioritize tasks and understand the importance of meeting other basic needs before leisure and entertainment. Besides prioritizing school work, adolescents should engage in physical activities for at least 60 minutes per day. This could be biking around the neighborhood or following a dance tutorial at home. As a parent, you can also encourage your teen to exercise by making it a family activity. This could be scheduling daily afternoon walks or plan family hiking trips during the weekend. Parents should also encourage teens to turn off electronics at least an hour before bedtime and have a “no phone at the table” rule. These routines teach teens good sleep hygiene and promote family connected time. For families who had these rules in place prior to the pandemic, it would be wise to continue to maintain them. For families who didn’t have these rules, now is a crucial time to start. By providing structure that helps everyone unplug, these rules help your teens stay mindful of their screen usage and maintain a sense of normalcy. Quality over quantity. Instead of focusing on keeping track of your teen’s daily screen time usage, it is more valuable to know how they are using that time. Quality screen time can be beneficial for both teens and parents. This could be having a family video game or movie night, or learning how to cook a new dish together through YouTube tutorials. According to Skillshare, an online learning platform, the demand for its online courses has tripled since the beginning of the mandatory lockdown. Interestingly, people are increasingly counting learning new hobbies and skills as a form of productivity. Encouraging teens to spend their screen time on learning new skills or getting creative can also promote curiosity and self-exploration. Lastly, go easy on your kid AND yourself. This pandemic is taking a toll on everyone’s well being and sanity. Therefore, it is important for parents to give themselves the time and resources they need for their own digital self-care. Apart from the amount of screen time dedicated for remote work, taking the extra time for screen-based entertainment can help parents destress and unplug from teen-related worries. By demonstrating healthy screen time habits, you’re setting a good example for your teen on how to manage work and play both on and off the screen.

6,"How to handle teen talk back. “I don’t have to listen to you” and “you’re not the boss of me” can be some of the most infuriating comments to hear as a parent of a teenager. Here’s why teens talk back and some strategies to diffuse your next unproductive argument. Why teens talk back. As teens strive for independence, it’s natural for them to talk back. Talk back is a side effect of your teen seeking autonomy. Part of that autonomy means that teens are looking for ways to assert themselves, even if it means coming off as rude or offensive at times. This egocentric behavior is normal in teen development and can even play a supporting role in helping your teen establish their own identity (a process formally called individualization). Don’t add fuel to the fire. As a parent, it’s common to want to reassert your power with statements such as “My roof, my rules” or “I am the boss of you”. However, this can spiral into a power struggle as your frustration can fuel your teen’s excitement that they have power over you. If you try to stop their rudeness with your authority, your reactions may be giving your teen’s rudeness more power than it should have. Ultimately, by leading with a “My roof, my rules” attitude, your behavior may be provoking your teen to test the limits of just how far your authority goes. Investigate with kindness. The key to diffusing talk back is helping your teen manage their own emotions, better known as emotional regulation. You can assist your teen in practicing emotional regulation by calmly listening and investigating the situation as opposed to meeting their disrespect with anger. Help your teenager recognize that you are invested in their needs and that they don’t have to act defiantly to get your attention. It could sound like, “I don’t know where that came from and I don’t like being spoken to that way, but I want to understand where you are coming from.” Talk it out and get to the underlying source of frustration. Take a breather. Another tactic to handle talk back is leaving the situation and coming back with a clearer mind. A phrase like, “The way you responded made me just lose my cool. I’m going to go for a walk and we can reconvene when I get back” not only demonstrates to your teen how you are able to regulate your own emotions, but models this behavior to teens as to how they can stand up for themselves when they are being mistreated. Your teen just wants independence. As teens are navigating their independence, talk back is almost guaranteed. But establishing your power over them is rarely the way to go. When parents resort to shutting down talk back, it can distract from the real situation at hand. So, next time your teen responds with undue snark, try to see it as their clunky attempt to practice independence and respond with compassionate listening. Check out more.

7,"6 great dinner conversation starters for your teen. Tired of the old “how are you doing?” and “how was school?” Try these conversation starters at dinner with your teen. Did you know having regular family meals and good dinner conversations reduce your teen’s likelihood to engage in high-risk behaviors such as substance use, school problems, and self harm? Having regular family meals leads to more connectedness through good conversations and earlier detection when something is off track. That said, good dinner conversations are easier said than done. By dinnertime, everyone has trudged through a long day’s worth of school, work, and socializing. You may feel completely unable to carry another conversation, especially with a teen whose vocabulary seems to be limited to three words: “Yeah”, “Nope”, “Dunno”. You’re not alone. 63% of parents surveyed in a study before COVID-19 reported feeling burnt out from their parenting duties. With the novel coronavirus affecting our daily lives, Americans, especially American parents, are reporting higher levels of stress than previous years. Break away from the usual “How was school?” questions that your teens have learned to tune out with these fun suggestions: Light-hearted starters. 1. Rose, bud, thorn? This is a specific yet open-ended way to ask “What were you up to today?” A rose describes something good that happened, a bud describes something that one looks forward to, and a thorn describes something not so positive that’s on their mind. Sometimes, questions that are too general (like “How was your day?”) doesn’t prompt discussion as easily as more targeted questions. Have everyone around the dinner table share their rose, bud, and thorn to check-in with each other. Having everyone participate helps your teens feel the sharing is equal, and plus, they often genuinely take interest in your experiences! 2. After you share a thorn in your day, ask your teen for some advice on how they would approach your situation. Not only will you get different perspectives on how to approach your thorny situation by practicing vulnerability in this safe way, you’re letting your teen know that you respect their opinions. Hearty main course. 3. Dust off your old photo books, dig into your memory, and share some personal photographs with your teen. Teens are generally curious about their parents’ past. In a survey that asked teens what they wanted to talk to their parents about, the top theme centered around the family. Around 43% of teens surveyed were curious about topics like “getting to know my parent” and “family history.” But, many families do not intentionally dig deep into this area of fruitful conversation, as most parent-teen conversations focus on the teen. Personal photographs are excellent triggers for your memory, and they also can also help your teen visualize your past. 4. Share your personal timeline from way back when, and get ready for questions! This is another way for your teen to learn more about you and your personal history. Give your teen a glimpse into your own teenage years, and describe the challenges you faced during your transition to adulthood. Even if your teen isn’t as willing to share with you, you can still work towards a home environment that encourages this exchange of stories by sharing yourself. 5. Share a story about your own parents, and perhaps your teen may have some more questions about their own grandparents. Sharing a story first is a great way to build up momentum in a conversation, as it relieves pressure off from your teens’ shoulders to contribute themselves. Hopefully, they may learn to initiate in the future. Also, sharing about your parents can explain to your teen where your parenting values come from and perhaps how parenting has changed generationally in your experience. It may also inspire questions in your teen to learn more about their family history. Room for dessert? 6. After dinner, ask your teen to help you bake some delicious desserts! Sometimes, conversations during shared activities are the most natural and fun! Doing something together creates shared meaning, as you’re pursuing a goal (however tasty!) together. This contributes to greater stability in your parent-teen relationship. We would love to hear from you about how your dinnertime conversations go! Cherish is also offering free resources (from coaching to curated parent community groups!) for parents with teens throughout COVID-19. Please keep in touch!"
8,"Lies, teens, & a little less misery. A whopping 82% of adolescents and young adults reported lying to their parents in a recent study. For many parents, knowing their teen might be lying is a huge source of anxiety. How did your adorable cherub of a child grow into a deceptive adolescent? (A note of hope: young adults engage in deception much less than teens. It’ll get better.) Despite its less than stellar reputation, lying signals an important milestone in your child’s developmental growth and social functioning. It is actually a skill that children have to learn and master because it relies on an understanding of theory of mind, or the existence of other perspectives. When a person lies, they implicitly have to understand that others have different beliefs that can be influenced or even fundamentally changed. Babies don’t have this skill nor understanding. But, it’s one thing for a five-year-old to weave together innocent stories of who ate the cookies, and quite another for your sixteen-year-old to lie about where she was, what she was doing, and who she was with when she missed curfew. Before interrogating her, however, try to reframe the situation and acknowledge that this is a typical phase of your child’s overall development. An increase in deviant behaviors, including lying, is actually normal, as it may be grounded in a natural push for autonomy. Nevertheless, it’s helpful to set clear boundaries and expectations around honesty in your home. Here are some steps you can take to foster an enduring and trustworthy relationship with your teen: 1. Understand the different categories of lying, and try to understand why they are lying. More often than not, lying is not a clear-cut sign of failure on anyone’s part. Most lies aren’t serious. Generally, there’s a reason for why teens lie and hide information from their parents. Small lies often serve as an excuse for your teen to get out of finishing chores or signal their growing need for privacy. Sometimes, people lie to preserve peace. Ultimately, trying to see things from your teen’s viewpoint enables you to have a more objective, holistic perspective of a situation, and this may calm you when you are upset at your teen. On the other hand, if lying becomes repetitive, it may be a warning sign of maladaptive coping for underlying emotional challenges (e.g., low self-esteem, depressive feelings, etc.) or fear (e.g., of punishment, judgement, failure). They may not be able to cope with difficult situations in a healthy way that doesn’t involve lying. So, you may need to engage them more to fully understand what’s going on, and then extend a helping hand. 2. Set clear and realistic house rules about negotiable and non-negotiable boundaries. While lying may increase miscommunication in relationships, make sure that you and your teen are on the same page when it comes to negotiable and non-negotiable behaviors. Set clear expectations about what the consequences will follow if non-negotiable boundaries are violated. Example of Negotiable Behaviors: Nat: Mom, I know I’m not supposed to hang out with friends until I’m done with all my school work. But it’s Andy’s birthday tomorrow and I’ve been stuck at home working for the last few weeks. Would it be okay for me to join his birthday party on Zoom this afternoon and then finish the rest of my work after? Mom: Ok, we can work around that. Good thinking to plan ahead and figure out when you’re going to get the rest done. Thanks for being honest with me. But, remember this shouldn’t happen too often! Example of Non-negotiable Behaviors: Dad: I want to make it very clear that in this household, smoking is prohibited. You will be grounded if you get your hands on cigarettes. Nat: Dad, it’s not a big deal. I know so many people at school who have smoked before. Dad: I know many teens try out smoking, but it can be a dangerous habit to fall into. Our family has a history with addiction, and this is not something your mother and I are comfortable with you doing. You have to be realistic, and try to remember that adolescence is an exciting time for your teen to become more independent and eventually assert themselves as independent adults. Help them along the way with clear reasoning, and expectations will make sure they know where the bright red lines are. 3. Fun fact: You can nudge your teen towards goodness and honesty. In a study that compared two groups of people who engaged in reward-based tasks, during which one group first recalled the 10 Commandments and the second group recalled 10 random books, the first group hardly cheated, whereas the second cheated often. The study concluded that when people are encouraged to think about their own morals, they tend to be more honest! So, to discourage lying, nudge your teen to think more about personal ethics! You could talk about whether or not justice was served in certain personal situations at work, for example, or in the news. And it may be a good idea for you to encourage self-reflection by asking them if they think their behaviors are good and fair every once in a while.
